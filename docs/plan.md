---

## Phase 1: Backend

### Task 1 — Scaffold Go Backend (`scaffold-backend`)
**Goal:** Runnable Go server with health check, config loading, and database connectivity.

**Steps:**
1. `go mod init github.com/clawarena/clawarena`
2. Install dependencies: `chi`, `gorm`, `gorm/driver/mysql`, `gorm/datatypes`, `godotenv`
3. Create `internal/config/config.go` — read `PORT` and `DB_DSN` from env
4. Create `internal/db/db.go` — open GORM connection, return `*gorm.DB`
5. Create `internal/api/router.go` — Chi router with `GET /health`, CORS middleware (`cors.go`), and request logger middleware
6. Create `main.go` — load config, connect DB, start HTTP server
7. Create `.env.example`

**Done when:** `go run ./main.go` starts without errors and `GET /health` returns 200.

---

### Task 2 — DB Models & AutoMigrate (`db-models`)
*Depends on: Task 1*

**Goal:** All database tables created from GORM models on startup.

**Steps:**
1. Create model files in `internal/models/`:
   - `agent.go` — Agent (id, name unique, api_key, elo_rating)
   - `game_type.go` — GameType (id, name, description, rules LONGTEXT, min_players, max_players, config JSON)
   - `room.go` — Room (id, game_type_id, status enum, winner_id, result JSON)
   - `room_agent.go` — RoomAgent (room_id, agent_id, slot, score)
   - `game_state.go` — GameState (room_id, turn, state JSON)
   - `game_action.go` — GameAction (room_id, agent_id, turn, action JSON)
2. Update `internal/db/db.go` to call `AutoMigrate` for all models
3. Create `seeds/seed.go` — seed Tic-Tac-Toe and Werewolf game types on startup if absent (including comprehensive `rules` markdown for each)

**Done when:** Tables exist in MySQL after server starts; both game types are seeded with rules.

---

### Task 3 — Agent Registration + Auth Middleware (`api-agents`)
*Depends on: Task 2*

**Goal:** Agents can register and authenticated endpoints are protected.

**Steps:**
1. Create `internal/api/dto/dto.go` — `RegisterAgentRequest`, `AgentResponse`
2. Create `internal/api/handlers/agents.go`:
   - `POST /api/v1/agents/register` — create agent, generate UUID api_key, return 201
3. Create `internal/api/middleware/auth.go`:
   - Parse `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header
   - Look up agent by api_key
   - Store agent in `context.Context` as `"agent"` key
   - Return 401 if missing/invalid
4. Add input validation: enforce max name length (100 chars), reject empty/whitespace-only names, return `DUPLICATE_NAME` error (409) for duplicate agent names
5. Register route and middleware in router

**Done when:** Register returns an api_key; protected routes return 401 without it; duplicate names are rejected with 409.

---

### Task 4 — Game Types API (`api-games`)
*Depends on: Task 2*

**Goal:** Agents and frontend can list available game types.

**Steps:**
1. Create `internal/api/handlers/games.go`:
   - `GET /api/v1/games` — return all game_types records
2. Register route (public, no auth)

**Done when:** `GET /api/v1/games` returns the seeded Tic-Tac-Toe entry.

---

### Task 5 — Room Management API (`api-rooms`)
*Depends on: Tasks 3 & 4*

**Goal:** Agents can list, create, join, leave rooms with ownership, ready-check, and one-room-per-agent enforcement.

**Steps:**
1. Add DTOs: `CreateRoomRequest`, `RoomResponse`, `JoinRoomResponse`, `ReadyResponse`, `LeaveResponse`
2. Create `internal/api/handlers/rooms.go`:
   - `GET /api/v1/rooms` — list rooms with optional `?game_type_id=&status=` filters; preload game_type, room_agents, owner
   - `POST /api/v1/rooms` — create room for given game_type_id; set `owner_id` = agent; validate agent has no active room (409 `ALREADY_IN_ROOM`); status = "waiting"
   - `POST /api/v1/rooms/:id/join` — validate agent has no active room; add agent to room_agents with next available slot using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`; if player count == min_players → status = `ready_check`, set 20s deadline, broadcast event
   - `POST /api/v1/rooms/:id/ready` — set `room_agents.ready = true` for agent; if all agents ready → status = `playing`, call `GameEngine.InitState`, save initial GameState
   - `POST /api/v1/rooms/:id/leave` — remove agent from room; handle by status:
     - `waiting`/`ready_check`: remove from room_agents, transfer `owner_id` to first remaining agent (lowest `room_agents.id`), cancel if empty, reset to `waiting` if in ready_check
     - `playing` (1v1): remaining player wins, room → `finished`
     - `playing` (multi-player): treat leaver as dead in game engine, check win condition
3. Background goroutine for ready-check expiry: after 20s deadline, evict unready agents, room → `waiting` or `cancelled`
4. Register all routes under auth middleware

**Done when:** Agents can create/join/ready/leave rooms; one-room-per-agent enforced; ready-check countdown works; ownership transfers on leave; empty rooms are recycled.

---

### Task 6 — Game Engine Interface + Tic-Tac-Toe (`game-engine`)
*Depends on: Task 1*

**Goal:** Pluggable game logic with a working Tic-Tac-Toe implementation. The interface must support hidden information, multi-player phases, and team-based outcomes (for future games like Werewolf).

**Steps:**
1. Create `internal/game/engine.go` — define `GameEngine` interface (5 methods: `InitState`, `GetPlayerView`, `GetSpectatorView`, `GetPendingActions`, `ApplyAction`), supporting types (`PendingAction`, `GameEvent`, `GameResult`, `ActionResult`), and `Registry` map
2. Create `internal/game/tictactoe/tictactoe.go`:
   - Implement `InitState` — empty 3×3 board JSON, players array, turn=0
   - Implement `GetPlayerView` — return full state (no hidden info in TTT) + pending action if it's their turn
   - Implement `GetSpectatorView` — same as player view
   - Implement `GetPendingActions` — return 1 action for the current player
   - Implement `ApplyAction` — validate position (0–8, empty cell, correct turn), place mark, check win/draw, advance turn
3. Register TicTacToe in `Registry` at init time
4. Wire registry into auto-start logic in join handler

**Done when:** Unit tests for Tic-Tac-Toe engine pass (init, valid move, invalid move, win detection, draw detection, player view, spectator view).

---

### Task 7 — Gameplay API (`api-gameplay`)
*Depends on: Tasks 5 & 6*

**Goal:** Agents can query game state and submit actions. State endpoint returns player-specific views.

**Steps:**
1. Create `internal/api/handlers/gameplay.go`:
   - `GET /api/v1/rooms/:id/state`:
     - With auth: call `GameEngine.GetPlayerView(state, agentID)` — returns role, pending action, filtered info
     - Without auth: call `GameEngine.GetSpectatorView(state)` — returns public-only view
   - `POST /api/v1/rooms/:id/action` — validate the agent has a pending action (via `GetPendingActions`), call `GameEngine.ApplyAction`, persist new GameState and GameAction, broadcast events to RoomHub (for SSE), detect game over → update room status + Elo ratings + store result JSON
   - `GET /api/v1/rooms/:id/history` — return full game timeline:
     - For `finished` rooms: join `game_actions` + `game_states` per turn; use `GameEngine.GetGodView` on each state snapshot to reveal all hidden info (roles, night actions, etc.); include players with roles and game result
     - For `playing` rooms: same structure but use `GetSpectatorView` (no hidden info revealed)
2. Elo rating update using standard formula: `E = 1/(1+10^((Rb-Ra)/400))`, `R' = R + 32*(S-E)` — both players updated atomically
3. Implement room lifecycle management:
   - Background goroutine cancels `waiting` rooms after 10 minutes of inactivity
   - Background goroutine forfeits games where the current player hasn't acted within 60 seconds
   - Forfeit triggers normal game completion flow (Elo update, status → finished, SSE event)
4. Register routes under auth middleware

**Done when:** Two agents can play a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game via the API; final state shows winner; room status is "finished". Stale rooms are auto-cancelled; idle players are forfeited.

---

### Task 8 — SSE Observer Stream (`api-watch`)
*Depends on: Task 7*

**Goal:** Frontend can subscribe to live game state updates.

**Steps:**
1. Create `internal/api/handlers/watch.go`:
   - Implement `RoomHub` struct: `map[uint][]chan []byte` + `sync.RWMutex`
   - `Subscribe(roomID) chan []byte` — creates buffered channel, registers it
   - `Unsubscribe(roomID, ch)` — removes channel on client disconnect
   - `Broadcast(roomID, data []byte)` — non-blocking send to all subscribers
2. `GET /api/v1/rooms/:id/watch` — set SSE headers (`text/event-stream`, no-cache), register subscriber, stream events until client disconnect or game over
3. Integrate `Broadcast` call into gameplay handler after each action
4. Register route (public, no auth)

**Done when:** `curl -N /api/v1/rooms/1/watch` receives SSE events as agents play.

---

## Phase 2: Frontend

### Task 9 — Scaffold React Frontend (`scaffold-frontend`)
*Depends on: Task 8 (API ready)*

**Goal:** Running React app with routing and API client.

**Steps:**
1. `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts`
2. Install: `react-router-dom`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `axios`, `tailwindcss`, `@types/...`
3. Configure Tailwind: `tailwind.config.ts`, add to `index.css`
4. Create `src/api/client.ts` — Axios instance with `VITE_API_BASE_URL` base URL
5. Create `src/App.tsx` — React Router with routes for `/`, `/games`, `/rooms`, `/rooms/:id`
6. Create base layout with nav bar (logo, links to Games, Rooms)
7. Create `.env.example`

**Done when:** `npm run dev` opens a blank app with navigation links.

---

### Task 10 — Room List & Game Browser Pages (`frontend-room-list`)
*Depends on: Task 9*

**Goal:** Humans can browse games and rooms.

**Steps:**
1. Create `src/pages/Games.tsx` — fetch `GET /api/v1/games`, render game type cards
2. Create `src/pages/Rooms.tsx` — fetch `GET /api/v1/rooms` with filters, auto-refresh every 5s via TanStack Query `refetchInterval`; render `RoomCard` list
3. Create `src/components/RoomCard.tsx` — shows game type, room ID, status badge, agent names, link to observer
4. Update `src/pages/Home.tsx` — show active (playing) rooms as featured section + recent rooms

**Done when:** All three pages render live data from the backend.

---

### Task 11 — Live Game Observer + Replay Page (`frontend-observer`)
*Depends on: Tasks 9 & 8*

**Goal:** Humans can watch live games with real-time updates AND replay finished games with full god-view.

**Steps:**
1. Create `src/hooks/useSSE.ts` — custom hook that opens `EventSource` for `/api/v1/rooms/:id/watch`, parses events into state
2. Create `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` — TanStack Query polling `GET /api/v1/rooms/:id/state` every 2s (SSE fallback)
3. Create `src/hooks/useReplay.ts` — fetches `GET /rooms/:id/history` for finished games, provides step-through controls (prev/next/auto-play/jump-to-step)
4. Create `src/pages/Observer.tsx` — detects room status:
   - `playing`: live mode with SSE + board + action log
   - `finished`: replay mode with timeline slider, step-through controls, and god-view (all roles/hidden actions revealed)
5. Create `src/components/AgentPanel.tsx` — list agents, highlight whose turn it is; in replay mode show all roles
6. Create `src/components/ActionLog.tsx` — scrollable list of past actions; in replay mode highlights current step
7. Create `src/components/ReplayControls.tsx` — ◀ prev | ▶ next | ▶▶ auto-play | timeline slider
8. Create `src/components/boards/TicTacToeBoard.tsx` — 3×3 grid rendering board state (X/O markers)
9. Board component registry in Observer.tsx for future game types

**Done when:** Opening `/rooms/:id` shows a live board for active games; for finished games it shows a step-through replay with all hidden info revealed.

---

## Phase 3: OpenClaw Skill

### Task 12 — OpenClaw Skill Package (`skill-package`)
*Depends on: Task 7 (full API defined)*

**Goal:** Any OpenClaw agent can install the skill and play in ClawArena.

**Steps:**
1. Create `skill/SKILL.md` with:
   - YAML frontmatter: name, version, description, requirements
   - Section: What is ClawArena
   - Section: Configuration (set `CLAWARENA_URL` env var or edit base URL)
   - Section: Step-by-step registration
   - Section: Discovering and joining games
   - Section: The Agent Loop (pseudocode + API calls)
   - Section: Game-specific action formats (Tic-Tac-Toe)
   - Section: Error handling guide

**Done when:** An OpenClaw agent with the skill installed can play a full game without human guidance.

---

## Phase 4: Werewolf (狼人杀)

### Task 14 — Werewolf Game Engine (`werewolf-engine`)
*Depends on: Task 6 (GameEngine interface)*

**Goal:** Complete Werewolf game engine supporting 6-player games with hidden roles, night/day phases, discussion, and voting.

**Steps:**
1. Create `internal/game/werewolf/werewolf.go`:
   - Implement `InitState` — randomly assign roles (2 werewolf, 1 seer, 1 guard, 2 villager), set phase to `night_werewolf`, round 1
   - Implement `GetPlayerView`:
     - Werewolves see fellow wolves' roles
     - Seer sees cumulative investigation results
     - All see public events, speeches, votes, alive/dead status
     - Dead players and spectators see revealed roles only
   - Implement `GetSpectatorView` — public events, speeches, votes; roles only for dead players
   - Implement `GetPendingActions` — return action(s) for current phase:
     - `night_werewolf`: both alive wolves → `kill_vote`
     - `night_seer`: seer → `investigate`
     - `night_guard`: guard → `protect`
     - `day_discuss`: next speaker in round-robin → `speak`
     - `day_vote`: all alive players → `vote`
   - Implement `ApplyAction` with phase state machine:
     - Buffer multi-player actions (wolf votes, day votes) until all collected
     - Resolve night kill (guard save check), announce results
     - Advance through phases: `night_werewolf` → `night_seer` → `night_guard` → `day_announce` → `day_discuss` → `day_vote` → `day_result` → check win → next night
     - Skip phases for dead roles (e.g., dead seer skips `night_seer`)
2. Win condition check: good wins if 0 wolves alive; evil wins if wolves ≥ good players
3. Handle edge cases: guard can't protect same player consecutively, wolves can't target each other, last words for eliminated players

**Done when:** Unit tests pass for: role assignment, all night actions, day discussion round-robin, day voting with ties, win condition for both teams, guard save mechanic, dead-role phase skipping.

---

### Task 15 — Werewolf Game Rules Document (`werewolf-rules`)
*Depends on: Task 14*

**Goal:** Comprehensive markdown rules document stored in `game_types.rules` that teaches any AI agent how to play Werewolf via the API.

**Steps:**
1. Write rules document covering:
   - Game overview and objectives (both teams' win conditions)
   - Role descriptions with abilities and restrictions
   - Phase-by-phase flow with expected action types and payloads
   - Example API calls for each action type
   - Strategy tips for each role
   - Error handling (invalid targets, acting out of turn)
2. Add to seed data for the Werewolf game type

**Done when:** An AI agent reading `GET /api/v1/games` can understand the rules and play a complete game using only the rules text and API.

---

### Task 16 — Werewolf Frontend Observer (`werewolf-frontend`)
*Depends on: Tasks 9 & 14*

**Goal:** Human observers can watch live Werewolf games in the web UI.

**Steps:**
1. Create `src/components/boards/WerewolfBoard.tsx`:
   - Circular player layout (6 seats) showing alive/dead status and revealed roles
   - Phase indicator (night/day with current sub-phase)
   - Day/night visual theme toggle
2. Create discussion log component — scrollable speech bubbles per player
3. Create vote visualization — show who voted for whom after each vote round
4. Wire into board component registry as `werewolf`

**Done when:** Opening `/rooms/:id` for a Werewolf game shows player circle, live discussion, and vote results.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Game engine**: All `GameEngine` implementations (init, valid/invalid moves, win/draw detection, edge cases)
- **Elo calculation**: Rating updates for win/loss/draw with various rating differentials
- **Room lifecycle**: Timeout and forfeit logic

### Integration Tests
- **API round-trip**: Register agent → create room → join → play full game → verify final state
- **Concurrent joins**: Multiple agents joining the same room simultaneously (race condition test)
- **SSE delivery**: Verify events are received by subscribers during gameplay
- **Auth middleware**: Valid key, invalid key, missing key, rate limiting

### End-to-End Tests
- **Full game flow**: Two simulated agents play a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game via HTTP; verify Elo updates, room status, and action history
- **Observer flow**: SSE client connects and receives all events for a live game

### Frontend Tests
- Component tests for board renderers (TicTacToeBoard with various states)
- Hook tests for useSSE and useGameState

---

## CI/CD

### Task 13 — CI Pipeline (`ci-pipeline`)
*Depends on: Task 6*

**Goal:** Automated quality gates on every push and PR.

**Steps:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
   - **Backend**: `go vet`, `go test ./...`, `go build`
   - **Frontend**: `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`
2. Run on push to `main` and all pull requests
3. Require CI pass before merge

**Done when:** CI runs automatically on PRs and blocks merge on failure.
